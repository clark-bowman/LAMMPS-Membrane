# SEC: This section initializes the simulation.

# 	Define units, atom style, log path, and neighbor settings; and read configuration data for the polymer.
# 	Configuration data for the polymer in polymer.dat must be generated separately.
# 	Final line communicates ghost data and is necessary for DPD parallelizing. On some versions of LAMMPS, use instead `communicate single vel yes'

# 	Define bond, angle, pairwise interactions.
# 	For pairwise interactions: type 1 is lipid head, 2 is lipid tail, 3 is water,
#   4 is filament, 5 is pinned filament, 6 is free monomers, 7 is terminal monomers, 8 is added filament.
#   43872 is a temperature seed; change for different randomness.
